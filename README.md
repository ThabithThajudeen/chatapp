I created a basic chat application using .NET. The chat app had the following features implemented: multiple user management, multiple chat room management, message distribution, private messaging, and file sharing. The description of the features the chat app had is as follows: 
user login, chat room selection, chat room creation, chat room messaging, private messaging, file sharing, and logout. I was part of a 2-member team that built the project.
